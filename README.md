# The Hidden Subgroup Problem
The hidden subgroup problem is a generalization of numerous different cryptographic problems that lie at the heart of nearly all public key exchange algorithms.
The challenge of solving the hidden subgroup problem has left the realm of classical computing and become an area of active study in quantum computing and quantum cryptography, primarily after the development of Shor's algorithm and other variations.
It is still only possible to solve (even on quantum computers) for relatively small public keys and furthermore for abelian groups.
